# ETL pipeline

## What I want

1. As a user, I want to be able to specify a variety of sources (websites, RSS feeds, local files) so that I can extract content for processing.
2. As a user, I want the extracted content to be transformed into a common data model so that it can be easily loaded into a database.
3. As a user, I want the transformed data to be loaded into a database so that it can be searched, processed, and annotated.
4. As a user, I want a complete record of all pipeline activities, including successes and failures, for auditing purposes.
5. As a user, I want to search, process and annotate the database content.

## Gemini response

The five points clearly capture the core functionality of an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline followed by a **content analysis** application.

The main areas for improvement are:
1.  **Defining User Roles:** "As a user" is good, but we can be more specific. There seem to be at least two roles: one who *manages* the pipeline and one who *uses* the data.
2.  **Breaking Down Epics:** Story #5 ("search, process and annotate") is a huge task (an "Epic"). It should be broken into smaller, more specific stories.
3.  **Defining the "Common Data Model":** This is a critical concept that needs to be defined, at least at a high level.
4.  **Adding Non-Functional Requirements:** These describe *how well* the system should work (e.g., performance, error handling).

Here is a revised and expanded version of your specification.

## Improved Software Specification

### 1. User Personas

To add clarity, we'll define two distinct user roles:

* **`Data Admin`:** This user is responsible for configuring, running, and monitoring the data ingestion pipeline. (Covers your stories 1-4).
* **`Content Analyst`:** This user is the primary consumer of the data. They are responsible for searching, reading, and annotating the content. (Covers your story 5).

### 2. Functional Requirements (User Stories)

The requirements can be split into two main modules: The Pipeline and The Application.

#### Module 1: The Data Pipeline (Ingestion & Storage)

* **Story 1 (Extract):** As a **Data Admin**, I want to configure and manage multiple data sources (including website URLs, RSS feeds, and local file paths) so that the system knows where to pull content from.
* **Story 2 (Schedule):** As a **Data Admin**, I want to be able to schedule ingestion jobs to run at specific intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) so that new content is fetched automatically.
* **Story 3 (Transform):** As a **Data Admin**, I want the system to automatically sanitize and transform all extracted content into a standardized "Article" data model (see section 3) so that all data in the database is consistent.
* **Story 4 (Load):** As a **Data Admin**, I want the transformed "Article" data to be automatically loaded and indexed into the central database so that it is available for users.
* **Story 5 (Audit):** As a **Data Admin**, I want to view a detailed pipeline activity log, filterable by date, source, and status (Success/Failure), so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot failures.
    * **5a (Error Detail):** As a **Data Admin**, when an ingestion job fails, I want the log to record a specific error message (e.g., "404 Not Found," "Parsing Error") so I know exactly what went wrong.

#### Module 2: The Content Application (Interaction & Analysis)

This module breaks down your original Story #5.

* **Story 6 (Search):** As a **Content Analyst**, I want to perform a full-text search across the *entire content* of all articles in the database so that I can find relevant information quickly.
* **Story 7 (Filter):** As a **Content Analyst**, I want to filter my search results by metadata, such as the original **source**, the **extraction date range**, and any **tags** or **annotations**.
* **Story 8 (View):** As a **Content Analyst**, I want to open a search result to view the clean, transformed article content along with its key metadata (e.g., source URL, extraction date).
* **Story 9 (Annotate - Tag):** As a **Content Analyst**, I want to be able to add one or more **tags** (e.g., "Urgent," "Finance," "Project X") to any article so that I can categorize and organize content.
* **Story 10 (Annotate - Comment):** As a **Content Analyst**, I want to be able to add free-text **comments** or notes to an article so that I can record my analysis or thoughts.
* **Story 11 (Process - Export):** As a **Content Analyst**, I want to be able to select one or more articles (e.g., from a search result) and **export** them (e.g., as CSV or JSON) so that I can perform further analysis in external tools.

### 3. Key Entities (High-Level Data Model)

This begins to define your "common data model." We can imagine the database having tables/collections like this:

* `Source`: Represents a place to get data.
    * `source_id` (Primary Key)
    * `name` (e.g., "Local News Feed")
    * `type` (e.g., RSS, URL, FILE)
    * `location` (The actual URL or file path)
    * `last_run_timestamp`

* `Article` (The Common Data Model): Represents a single piece of extracted content.
    * `article_id` (Primary Key)
    * `source_id` (Foreign Key to `Source`)
    * `title`
    * `content_text` (The cleaned, extracted text)
    * `original_url` (Link back to the source)
    * `extraction_date`
    * `publication_date` (If available from the source)

* `Annotation`: A note or tag made by a user on an article.
    * `annotation_id` (Primary Key)
    * `article_id` (Foreign Key to `Article`)
    * `user_id` (Connects to a user)
    * `type` (e.g., TAG, COMMENT)
    * `content` (The text of the tag or comment)
    * `created_at`

* `PipelineLog`: The audit record from your original Story #4.
    * `log_id` (Primary Key)
    * `timestamp`
    * `source_id` (Which source was being processed)
    * `status` (e.g., SUCCESS, FAILED)
    * `message` (e.g., "Extracted 5 new articles" or "Error: Timeout at URL")
    * `records_processed` (Number)

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

These define the system's quality and constraints.

1.  **Error Handling:** The pipeline must be fault-tolerant. If a single source fails (e.g., a website is down), it should log the error and continue processing other sources.
2.  **Scalability:** The system must be designed to handle an initial load of 1,000 sources, processing up to 10,000 new articles per day.
3.  **Performance:** Search queries from the `Content Analyst` (Story 6) must return results in under 3 seconds, even with millions of articles in the database.
4.  **Security:** (Assuming you have user accounts) All annotation actions must be authenticated. A user must be logged in to add a tag or comment.
5.  **Data Integrity:** The transformation process (Story 3) must never delete or overwrite existing, processed articles. It should only add new ones or update existing ones if explicitly designed to do so.

### 5. Key Questions to Clarify

This improved spec raises new questions you'll need to answer:

1.  **What does "process" mean?** In your original Story #5, you listed "search, process and annotate." I interpreted "process" as "export" (Story 11), but does it mean something else, like running an NLP model on the text?
2.  **What kind of database?** The model above is relational (like PostgreSQL), but a NoSQL document database (like MongoDB or Elasticsearch) might be better for full-text search and a flexible `Article` model.
3.  **Are there user accounts?** My spec assumes "yes" to support annotations. If not, how are annotations tracked?
4.  **What local files?** For Story 1, what formats do you expect for "local files" (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.pdf`)? Each will require a different parser.

1.  **What does "process" mean?** 
Process implies parsing several articles, extracting word clouds, finding named entities, clustering articles by topic or by shared named entitities, finding association rules using words or phrases or named entities.

2.  **What kind of database?** The model above is relational (like PostgreSQL), but a NoSQL document database (like MongoDB or Elasticsearch) might be better for full-text search and a flexible `Article` model.
I want a relational database (perhaps sqlite in the development stage, and PostgreSQL in the production stage)

3.  **Are there user accounts?**
There are users accounts with different roles: admin and data analyst.

4.  **What local files?** 
I expect some local files ('txt', 'md', 'csv', 'docx', 'xlsx', 'pdf', 'jpg', 'png', 'webp') to be processed with different parsers.
